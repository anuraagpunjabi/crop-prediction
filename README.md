Problem Statement: Crop Prediction

Group Members : Auraag Punjabi , Abhiskek Odrani , and Mohit Peshwani

Python Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, sklearn , seaborn , matplotlib

Software Used: Google Colaboratory (https://research.google.com/colaboratory/)

Machine Learning Algorithms Used: 
1. Random Forest : Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML. Random forests creates decision trees on randomly selected data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It also provides a pretty good indicator of the feature importance.
2. Linear Regression : Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). Linear regression is performed upon the data. It is used to predict the crop when the input features are provided.
